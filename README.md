### Stock analysis for Steve
The purpose of this project is to help Steve analyze DAQO and a few other greenenergy stocks, so that he has enough information to make a decision about diversifying his parents' funds. In doing this, we needed to analyze how actievly DQ performed in the past, analyze other stock options to find the best performers, while making sure our VBA code had the shortest possible run time. 

### Results
##### Stock Performance for 2017
Overall, with regards to returns, 2017 was a better year. All but TERP had positive returns with DQ posting the highest at 199%. Three other stocks asides DQ had more than 100% return. 

##### Stock Performance for 2018
All but ENPH and RUN had nagative returns. The top three highest losses were seen in DQ, JKS and SPWR; each posting losses of 63%, 61% and 45% respectively. 

##### Execution times 
For the original code, the run times for both years were over 47,000 secs, as compared to the average time of about 0.18 secs for the refactored code (going as low as 0.12 secs sometimes).

### Summary
#### Refatoring a Code

##### Advantages 
Refactoring made the programming faster, it improved readability and significantly reduced run time. 

##### Disadvantages 
Debugging wasn't very intuitive, it took a little more time to figure out the glitches.
